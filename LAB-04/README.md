# Welcome to the Visual Builder workshop.
This workshop will teach you how to create a new Oracle Visual Builder mobile application, that will allow you to take a photo with the mobile camera and upload it to Oracle Cloud (OCI) Object Storage.

You probably donâ€™t need it, but if you want to take a look you can find a detailed manual for Visual Builder [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/app-builder-cloud/visual-builder-developer/index.html)
