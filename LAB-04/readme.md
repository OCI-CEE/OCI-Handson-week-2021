# Welcome to the Visual Builder workshop.
This workshop will teach you how to create a progressive mobile application, that will allow you to take photos with your mobile camera and upload it instantaneously to Oracle Cloud Object Storage.

Oracle Visual Builder is a Low Code platform that uses a simplified interface and lets developers build applications and software that is both user-friendly and responsive. Rather than writing several lines of complex code and language structure, you can quickly and easily utilize Low Code and drag-and-drop the pieces youâ€™ll need to construct total applications with user interfaces, security, combinations and information. 
Have fun developing your mobile app and upload some cool photos!
