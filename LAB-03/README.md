# Welcome to the Kubernetes and DevOps workshop.
The Oracle Kubernetes Environment is used to deploy microservices. 
In this series of labs we will focus on the specific features of Kubernetes to run Microservices. 
This workshop also covers ways to automate your release process with DevOps pipelines.
These labs use a pre-built set of docker images.
